### About me


**imYamadaa/imYamadaa** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a university student in Japan.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Software Engineering.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Yamada
- âš¡ Fun fact: truth be told, my actual name has nothing to do with "Yamada"
